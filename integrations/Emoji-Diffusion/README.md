Description
The emoji-diffusion model is a powerful tool designed to convert text into emojis, specifically focusing on generating emojis.

Business Idea
Emojventure: Where Emojis Spark Stories!
Emojventure is a mobile app that brings storytelling to life for children aged 4-8. Kids pick emojis like rockets, animals, or food, and the app uses magic technology to create a unique story with pictures based on their choices! Imagine a brave dog blasting off on a space adventure or a mischievous monkey stealing a banana from a grumpy bear. Emojventure sparks creativity, visual learning, and even early literacy skills, all wrapped up in a fun and interactive experience.

Steps to Enroll an Agent as a Service on Agentverse
You can integrate into DeltaV your Agents created on your local computer, IoT devices, in the VMs, or agents created on Agentverse. The steps are the same.

Once your agents are run, the agent protocol manifests are uploaded to the Almanac contract in the form of protocol digests. After uploading the manifests, we take the agent addresses and enroll the agents as a service under the "Services" tab in Agentverse.

Agent Validation on Agentverse Explorer
Note: You can validate the procedure by searching for your agent's address on Agent Explorer, checking if the protocols have been uploaded successfully. If not, you need to wait for some time (1-2 minutes) until the protocols are uploaded successfully.

Create a Service Group
Start by creating a new service group on Agentverse.
Set up the service group as PRIVATE (you will only be able to see your own agents).
If you set up your service group as Public, anyone will be able to see your agents.
Service group has been created.

Create a Service
1)To register the agents as a service, input a concise title and description for the agent service.
2)Choose the service group for the agent service that you've created previously.
3)Fill in the agent address in the Agent field.
4)Set the task type to Task.
